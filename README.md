# Temp-Reg-for-TStat-Field-Devices
Temperature Regulation Energy Initiative for T-Stat Sensors on FPT Units

This project is designed to take readings from an outside air probe (Stationed on a commerical building in Seattle, WA), and maninuplate the data to reflect internal temperatures in order to maximize savings on electrical costs.

Ideas for improvement:
1. Weather Data Analysis - Variable Heating Goal (Setpoint limits vs Hard Setpoint)
2. Printup of energy savings - conversion formulas, avg energy/heating costs.
3. Visual logic file to be developed and connected to the exisiting building dynamic - connection to sensors, etc. (This will likely have to remain private under NDA)
4. Internal Temp analysis - I may be able to find some savings in a modeled analysis of time it takes to heat up building zones. The less time it takes, the less we have to stall at Occuped temp.
